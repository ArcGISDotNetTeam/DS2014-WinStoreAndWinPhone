DS2014-WinStoreAndWinPhone
==========================

Complete sample applications for Windows Store and Windows Phone from the 2014 Developer Summit session "Building Windows Store and Windows Phone Apps with ArcGIS Runtime SDK."  The applications demonstrate how to use the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET to edit data, take data offline, sync offline data, and leverage a user's location - all while following a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) implementation pattern.  Due to the MVVM architecture and cross-platform portability of the ArcGIS Runtime SDK, all ViewModel and business logic is shared between the Windows Store and Windows Phone applications contained within the sample.

NOTE: For the sample to work, you must edit App.xaml to specify the user name and password of an ArcGIS Online Organizational user account.  The Windows Phone and Windows Store Visual Studio projects each have their own copy of App.xaml; the credentials must be specified in both for both to function.
